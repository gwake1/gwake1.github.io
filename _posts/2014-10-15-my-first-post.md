Hello World!

This is my first blog post as a student in Cohort 7 at the Nashville Software School.  My time here so far has been exciting and stimulating.  NSS really delivers on the immersive aspect of this program.  I strongly caution anyone considering this program to be devoted to learning like this is a new language.

As part of learning any new language you build your foundation in the structure of the language.  Simple things like properly tabbing each line of code allow others to breeze through what you are trying to communicate.  These foundations instill the necessary skills of attention-to-detail which is necessary for a career in this field.

Before you can speak the language like a native, you often times have to check your references.  I have been able to rely on Google searches, IRC and pure frustration to constantly enhance my understanding of this new language.  One way in which I have gained a new appreciation for this field has been through monitoring the ways in which I benefit from others' content.

It is very tempting to retrofit your site based off of what somebody else has already done.  This method, however, does not contribute to the process of learning.  Despite the common saying "Good artists copy, great artists steal" every artist has a style.  The artist's style is steeped in the foundations of how he learned his craft.  As easily as Rembrandt's baroque style of painting clashes with Degas impressionist surrealism.  At the core of every work there are identifiable markers.

I am not trying to say what we do as developers is an art, but stealing from others cheapens our work and our ability.  One unexpected consequence of beginning this path is a greater appreciation for others' intellectual property.  Having gone through the process of building a site and making sure every detail is right, it is a smack-in-the-face to see someone else copy my work.  Not that I have seen anyone copy my work in this manner, but some of my classmates have.

As a token of respect to all those who have come before me I will engage in using a Creative Commons License for all of my work created while at the Nashville Software School.  More specifically, I will engage in licensing my work as an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International.  This allows others to share and adapt my work for non-commercial use.  I don't intend to profit directly from the information that I contribute to this site but will contribute in kind to the many free resources that have been made available to me.  

The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/"> Creative Commons website</a> has been a useful source and provide some peace of mind.  The license agreement between content providers and users helps to maintain a collaborative environment with understood ground rules.

I want to welcome you to my blog where you can expect to receive technical and general updates on my progress towards becoming a full-stack developer.  My hope is that this site may serve as a reference to individuals in need for a way to understand their new craft at similar stages of progression.  

The saga will continue, check back for more updates!
