Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post.  In this and future posts I am going to inform you on my choice to become a web developer.  This blog will be my outlet for frustration and sharing knowledge.  So you may ask... why become a developer?
<br>
<h1><em>Because Coding is Insanity!</em></h1>

First off, we are talking to computers.  How fricking cool is that?!  Well, sometimes computers aren't that smart.  You may have one idea in your head but when you ask the computer it just returns undefined or some kind of NullReferenceException.  At this point, I normally tell the computer "Its not you, it's me, and that is why I have to leave you now."

It really is amazing how we can communicate to machines.  How semantic meaning from our brains can be translated, into code that the computer understands, blows my mind.  This is such a feat that, rarely am I surprised that the computer doesn't understand what I am saying.

The lack of surprise comes from realizing that this computer is no dummy.  The computer probably understands the structure of language better than I do.  In fact, I know it does.  So it's no surprise when it politely tells me that I don't know what I'm doing.  From the computer's, perspective it's like trying to talk to a baby, and I am the baby.

<h1><em>If at first you don't succeed, you probably won't the second time... nor the third...</em></h1>

This is why coding is insanity, because it is fraught with failure.  Never has the saying that "Success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration" been more true.  I constantly beat my head against the wall and this is why I have chosen to become a developer.

All around the world people are beating their heads against the wall, and its not only the cool kids either.  Software development is to the 21st century what the railroad and automobile were to the 19th and 20th.  Software development is living in the world of rapid invention.  I want to be a part of this process.  To be a software developer is like becoming the modern day Renaissance man.

We are living in times that are rapidly changing.  The traditional economy is constantly being challenged.  The nature of employment is ever evolving. Much of this can be contributed to computers.  We are living in an age where more and more people are being paid to think rather than to complete mindless repetitive tasks.  The computer now and will continue in the future to take responsibility for mentally tasking low skill repetitive chores. The process by which it does this may be disruptive but it will make way to provide time for us to do more of what matters.  I don't know where the future of our economy may lie but we are using computers and softwares to make our lives more efficient.  It is my belief ultimately that this will increase everyone's quality of life.  This is why I have chosen to become a developer, because there is vast opportunity to increase the efficency and optimization of products, services, and platforms to increase our wellbeing. What a time to be alive.
